## üåü Overview  

Knovo transforms traditional quizzing into an **immersive, voice-driven learning experience**.  
Instead of static question banks, it dynamically generates quizzes from **form input (titles, PDFs)** , or **voice input (Vapi Workflow)** using **Gemini AI**. Learners attempt quizzes in **voice** mode  with a **Vapi Agent (A Quizmaster)** , get **real-time feedback**, and compete with others via **leaderboards**.  

Our **Mission** / **Purpose**: Make learning **inclusive, engaging, and personalized** ‚Äî for **students, educators,** and especially the **visually impaired** who benefit from a screen-free, hands-free quiz experience.
